# 1) RULE NUMBER 1: a VARIABLE must always, EQUAL, a VALUE.
# Examples
            # (a)
Name = "Onyiriuba Leonard" # Data Type here is STRING
# Variable = Name
# Assignment Operator (=)
# Value = "Onyiriuba Leonard"

            # (b)
Age = 23 # Data Type here is INT
# Variable = Age
# Assignment Operator (=)
# Value = 23

            # (c)
Weight = 82.8 # Data Type here is FLOAT
# Variable = Weight
# Assignment Operator (=)
# Value = 82.8

            # (d)
Happy = True # Data Type here is BOOL
# Variable = Happy
# Assignment Operator (=)
# Value = True

            # (e)
Crying = False # Data Type here is BOOL
# Variable = Happy
# Assignment Operator (=)
# Value = True



# THINGS TO NOTE:
    # 1) Only one VALUE was stored in all our variables
    # 2) The equation for STORING INFORMATION is given as (VARIABLE = VALUE)
    # 3) We saw how to use the ASSIGNMENT Operator and it is our EQUAL TO sign










# 2) RULE NUMBER 2: Always adhere to the VARIABLES NAMING CONVENTION.
# Examples               
# DON'T DO THE FOLLOWING WHEN NAMING VARIABLES: 
#         a) 9man = 17
#         b) man is fish = 23 
#         c) the man's name = "John"   

# DO THIS INSTEAD:
#         a) man9 = 17
#         b) man_is_fish = 23
#         c) the_mans_name = "John"

# NOTE: All spaces that you may ever want to create can be represented with an UNDERSCORE (_)
                
 
                
 
    
 
    
 
    
    
# 3) RULE NUMBER 3: Always remember that python is CASE SENSITIVE
# Example: "NAME" as a variable is not equal to "Name" or "name" or "nAME".      
                
                
                
     
                
     
        
     
        
# 4) RULE NUMBER 4: You need to MASTER SUBSTITUTION EFFECT in PYTHON 
# Many people refer to this as calling the variable.
